### attention

 - The reflector was adapted from AR goggles for smartphones and its official name is unknown. Please look for something similar in the picture.
 - I use 6inch ones instead of 5inch ones. Also, you will need the same conversion board as shown in the [picture](https://github.com/ugokutennp/OpenThree/blob/main/images/Display.jpg), so please purchase a set with MIPI drivers.
 - The head strap is adapted from a welding one. Use whatever you like.
 - The Type A connector is attached to use the VIVE CE cable (power supply for the display). The connection to the display driver board is made with a pin header and cable as shown in the [picture](https://github.com/ugokutennp/OpenThree/blob/main/images/Power.jpg).
